"""We are given an array of closed intervals,
intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time.
The input array is sorted with respect to the start times of each interval. For example,
intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[7,9]][ [1,4], [3,6], [7,9] ]
is sorted in terms of start times 1,31, 3, and 77.

Your task is to merge the overlapping intervals
and return a new output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals."""
